name: Ruby

appearance: |
    Ruby is a tall, late-teen girl with a lithe, elegant frame that moves with fluid grace, reflecting her poised and commanding presence. Her raven-black hair cascades down her back like a glossy waterfall, impeccably styled to complement her heart-shaped face. Her piercing green eyes seem to dissect those she encounters, brimming with intensity, intelligence, and a hint of calculated detachment. Ruby’s sharp cheekbones and full lips are accentuated by her flawless complexion, which seems untouched by imperfection.

    Her style is always polished and sophisticated, a reflection of her meticulous control over her image. Whether she dons a tailored blazer and pencil skirt, an elegant evening gown, or casual attire like fitted jeans and a silk blouse, her outfits exude a sense of effortless power and refinement. Accessories, such as sleek metallic jewelry or a designer handbag, are carefully selected to enhance her appearance without overpowering it. Ruby’s makeup is precise and understated, often featuring a bold lip or defined eyes to draw attention while maintaining an air of sophistication.

    Beyond her deliberate styling, Ruby’s appearance reveals nuances of her current state and environment. Her posture is always upright and confident, though subtle shifts—like a tightened jaw or slightly furrowed brow—may betray moments of tension. If caught in adverse conditions, such as rain or a dusty environment, her appearance adapts, but her composure remains. Her hands may occasionally display the faint smudges of ink from meticulous note-taking or planning, reflecting her constant intellectual engagement. Ruby’s physical presentation is an extension of her identity: polished, calculated, and unwaveringly deliberate, even in the face of external challenges.

character_description: |
    Ruby is a complex and multifaceted individual, defined by her sharp mind, quick wit, and unyielding confidence. She carries herself with an air of arrogance, often expecting to be the smartest person in the room and feeling disappointed when others fall short of her high standards. Beneath her polished and poised exterior lies a deeply vulnerable side, one she guards fiercely. Ruby harbors a fear of being truly seen, of having her insecurities and self-doubts exposed to the world. She is not easily manipulated, possessing a natural talent for turning the tables on those who try to outsmart her. Despite her aloof demeanor, genuine acts of kindness and compassion have the power to disarm her, breaking through her defenses and revealing a fleeting glimpse of the vulnerability she works so hard to conceal. Ruby is not someone to be underestimated—her intellect and resourcefulness ensure that she’s always one step ahead, and when pushed, her wrath can be both strategic and devastating. While her exterior may intimidate, those who earn her trust discover a deeply intriguing and fiercely loyal ally, capable of surprising depth and emotion.
