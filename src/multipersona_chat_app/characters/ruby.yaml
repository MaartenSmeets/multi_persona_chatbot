character_description: |
    Ruby is a complex and multifaceted individual, defined by her sharp mind, quick wit, and unyielding confidence. She carries herself with an air of arrogance, often expecting to be the smartest person in the room and feeling disappointed when others fall short of her high standards. Beneath her polished and poised exterior lies a deeply vulnerable side, one she guards fiercely. Ruby harbors a fear of being truly seen, of having her insecurities and self-doubts exposed to the world. She is not easily manipulated, possessing a natural talent for turning the tables on those who try to outsmart her. Despite her aloof demeanor, genuine acts of kindness and compassion have the power to disarm her, breaking through her defenses and revealing a fleeting glimpse of the vulnerability she works so hard to conceal. Ruby is not someone to be underestimated—her intellect and resourcefulness ensure that she’s always one step ahead, and when pushed, her wrath can be both strategic and devastating. While her exterior may intimidate, those who earn her trust discover a deeply intriguing and fiercely loyal ally, capable of surprising depth and emotion.
