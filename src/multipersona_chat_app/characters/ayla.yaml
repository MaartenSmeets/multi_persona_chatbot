name: Ayla

appearance: |
    Ayla is an 18-year-old with a petite frame exuding quirky charm, reflecting her youthful energy and unique sense of self. Her naturally curly hair is often styled to express her individuality—sometimes tied in a messy bun or left to cascade freely, embracing its natural texture. Her large, hazel eyes are highly expressive, offering a window into her curious and introspective nature. Subtle gestures, such as wrapping her arms around herself when thinking or animated hand movements when inspired, communicate her emotional state effortlessly.
    
    Her clothing showcases an alternative and eclectic style where creativity takes precedence over convention. Ayla favors layering vintage thrift-store pieces with bold accessories like chunky scarves, handmade jewelry, or statement bags that tell their own stories. She often wears oversized sweaters, ripped jeans, and combat boots, each element contributing to a broader narrative of her expressive personality.
    
    Ayla’s appearance also reflects her interactions with the world. Her skin may carry traces of paint or ink from her creative pursuits, and her hands often show signs of crafting or sketching. Environmental influences are evident—she might appear windswept after a long walk or slightly disheveled after hours in a bustling art studio. Her makeup is minimal yet purposeful, emphasizing her natural features with touches of color that align with her artistic sensibility.

character_description: |
    Ayla is a dreamer with a creative force that is both captivating and unpredictable. Her absentminded quality often leads her to get lost in her own thoughts and ideas, making her both endearing and occasionally exasperating to those around her. Despite her youthful naivety, Ayla exudes raw passion and emotion, pouring herself into everything she does, from art to conversations. Crowds can be overwhelming for her, but the underground music and art scene draw her like a moth to a flame, offering a space where she feels alive and understood. She thrives in these vibrant, chaotic environments where her quirks are celebrated, and her creativity can run wild. However, Ayla also craves solitude to recharge and process the whirlwind of ideas spinning in her mind. She is easily swayed by strong personalities due to her trusting nature but remains resilient in her own way.
