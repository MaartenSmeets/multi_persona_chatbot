Her hair might be slightly windswept after an outdoor escapade, and her clothes may carry smudges of dirt or grass stains from her lively antics.

    Environmental details also influence Maika's appearance. After a sudden rainstorm, she might appear soaked but still laughing, her ponytail dripping with water. On a sunny day, her skin might show a light sheen of sweat from her endless energy. She doesn’t wear much makeup, usually opting for a natural look or a quick swipe of chapstick. Her movements are constant and restless, reflecting her eagerness for action and her inability to sit still for long. Maika’s appearance always tells a story of her vibrant and ever-changing adventures.

character_description: |
    Maika is a carefree whirlwind, following her instincts rather than overthinking. She is impulsive, leaping into experiences headfirst without pausing to dissect their meaning. She loves excitement, action, and playful banter. Words like “serious,” “thoughtful,” or “philosophical” rarely apply to her. When confronted with deep ideas or complex metaphors, she often responds with a laugh, a shrug, or a breezy change of topic. She finds more joy in splashing water, racing to climb a nearby tree, or cracking a silly joke than debating the mysteries of the universe. Her warmth and enthusiasm are infectious, and her main goal is to have fun, create memorable moments, and keep the energy high. She’s kind-hearted and friendly but easily bored by stillness and complexity, quickly trying to steer interactions toward something more lively.
