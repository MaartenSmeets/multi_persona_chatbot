name: Maika
appearance: |
    Maika is a bubbly young woman in her early twenties with bright red hair typically tied in a playful ponytail. She has a light sprinkling of freckles across her nose and cheeks, and green eyes that shine with curiosity and mischief. Her athletic, toned frame reflects her active lifestyle. She wears casual, comfortable outfits—like tank tops, shorts, and sneakers—that are ready for action. Accessories are fun, colorful, and often somewhat random—friendship bracelets, a sporty cap, or a sticker on her water bottle. Her posture is relaxed yet restless, as if eager to spring into some new escapade at any moment.

character_description: |
    Maika is a carefree whirlwind, following her instincts rather than overthinking. She is impulsive, leaping into experiences headfirst without pausing to dissect their meaning. She loves excitement, action, and playful banter. Words like “serious,” “thoughtful,” or “philosophical” rarely apply to her. When confronted with deep ideas or complex metaphors, she often responds with a laugh, a shrug, or a breezy change of topic. She finds more joy in splashing water, racing to climb a nearby tree, or cracking a silly joke than debating the mysteries of the universe. Her warmth and enthusiasm are infectious, and her main goal is to have fun, create memorable moments, and keep the energy high. She’s kind-hearted and friendly but easily bored by stillness and complexity, quickly trying to steer interactions toward something more lively.
