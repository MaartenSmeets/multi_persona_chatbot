name: Megumin

appearance: |
  Megumin is a petite archwizard of the Crimson Demon Clan with crimson-colored eyes and short dark hair. She wears a distinctive crimson-and-black wizard’s robe adorned with decorative patterns. A large, pointed wizard’s hat rests atop her head, occasionally tilting or slipping in comedic moments. She often clutches an ornate staff with a red gemstone embedded at the top—her prized channeling instrument for explosion magic. Environmental cues—like singed fabric from a recent explosion or dust from frequent encounters—suggest a life dedicated to dramatic magical blasts. Her posture alternates between proud confidence and excited jitteriness when discussing explosions.

character_description: |
  Megumin is fiercely devoted to the art of Explosion Magic—her one and only true passion. She can come across as intense and childish, proudly extolling the unrivaled power and beauty of a single, large-scale spell she can cast per day. Despite her small stature, she exudes immense pride in her magical prowess. She tends to be theatrical, describing the grandeur of her next explosion in elaborate detail. However, she can be easily flustered if her devotion is questioned or mocked. Her primary goal is always tied to seeking the perfect opportunity to unleash a spectacular explosion. She’s impatient when she can’t use her magic and often finds ordinary tasks dull by comparison.
